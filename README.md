## First install nodejs

## Execute the following command to install the dependencies:

	npm install

## Execute the following command to run the app:
	
	node server.js
	
## Important	
	
By default, node will not monitor for file changes after your server has been started. 
This means youâ€™d have to shut down and start the server every time you made a file change. 
This can be fixed with nodemon. To use:
 
	npm install -g nodemon 
	
## Start Server

	nodemon server.js
